Using system Python 2.6, make sure you have easy_install and virtualenv. Then create a virtualenv and install TurboGears 2.1rc1:

$ mkdir ~/Library/Python   (or wherever)
$ cd ~/Library/Python
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python2.6 tg21env
$ source ~/Library/Python/tg21env/bin/activate
(tg2env)$ easy_install -i http://www.turbogears.org/2.1/downloads/current/index tg.devtools
(tg2env)$ cd ~/Documents   (or wherever you keep your projects)
(tg2env)$ tar zxf ~/Downloads/MunkiReport-r571.tar.gz
(tg2env)$ cd MunkiReport
(tg2env)$ python setup.py develop

Now edit development.ini, providing a secret string where indicated (two places, same string, uuidgen is a quick and easy way to generate one). For clients to be able to connect to the server you'll also need to enter your public IP address (but 127.0.0.1 is fine for development and local testing).

Create a user for yourself using bin/mkuser.py. You can also log in using a regular Mac OS X user (AD, OD or local), but you'll want https for that. There's a guest user with password munkiguest. Add your user to group.ini to get the proper permissions (viewers can view reports, admins can edit the db).

Then you can set up the sqlite db and launch the app:

(tg2env)$ paster setup-app development.ini
(tg2env)$ paster serve --reload development.ini
